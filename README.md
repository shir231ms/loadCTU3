**Data Structure**
>The type, "Polygon", points to a circular doubly linked list.  
>The circular doubly linked list stores Edges and Vertexs details.
>"main.cpp" just needs to refer "PEdll.h".

**PointNodeLL.h**
>sort polygons specially.
>add "PointNodeLL.h" for storing sorted X points and Y points.

**getWord function in "main.cpp"**
>use getWord function for gaining word from ".ctu3" file.
>change the type of the floating numbers from "long double" to "double" type.

**loadCTU3.m**
>add "loadCTU3.m" for reading the output file, "data.txt", of "main.cpp", 
>and then draw those polygons out (only lines, no arcs).

**Vector2D.h**
>compute the intersecting points between arc-line & line-line
>output "intersect.txt"(line-line,blue points) & "intersect_c.txt"(arc-line,red points) for drawing out.
